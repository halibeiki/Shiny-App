# Shiny-App: Predict the MPG of a Car

This application uses a dataset of a collection of cars (mtcars) and estimates the gas consumption (MPG) of any particular car based on the specifications that the user enters. 

The specifications required here are: 

 1- Number of Cylinders
 2- Engine Gross horsepower
 3- Weight (1000 lbs) 
 4- Speed (1/4 mile time (sec))
 5- Transmission: either Automatic or Manual
 6- Number of forward gears
 7- Number of carburetors
 
 Once the user provides all the needed information, the car's MPG will be calculated (predicted) based on data analysis on the MTCARS dataset. The user can compare his/her guess with the data-driven estimation.
